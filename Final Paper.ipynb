    "The US Unemployment Insurance Program is a social insurance program that aims to complement wages for claimants who have lost a significant amount of their livable wages. The first unemployment program was created at a state level in 1932 for the great State of Wisconsin. It was in 1935 where the federal government created a similar program that would bring the program nationwide but administered by states.\n",
    "Unemployment eligibility is determined by a set of requirements, which often vary by states. Generally speaking, if the separation from the employee is without cause (e.g., fired for misconduct) then the person is eligible for unemployment benefits. Said another way, if a person simply leaves a job without “good cause” then they are not eligible for unemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a brief overview of the funding structure, unemployment programs are funded by both federal and state payroll taxes. In most states employers pay state and federal unemployment taxes if they pay an employee more than $1500 or more for any quarter or if they had an employee for any business day in the quarter. This in turn builds a trust fund from which benefits are distributed upon confirmation of eligibility of claimants. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many residents of states were faced with safeguarding their lives from a deadly pandemic which in turn led them to staying at home. The other side of safeguarding their livelihoods resulted in large amounts of unemployment, which ultimately many state systems were not setup to manage. Unemployment Agencies in turn had to serve a larger amount of the population at top performance levels, while trying to ensure low overall improper payments made to claimants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, during COVID-19 state unemployment agencies faced many changes and issues with their programs and processes.\n",
    "This study looks at the history of unemployment disbursement from 2016 - 2021 as measured by improper payment rates. Specifically, we hope to understand if certain states that have higher budgets, federal funding, capital expenditures, education, populations have a correlation to improper payment rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide more detail on the overall problem, walkthrough of the data sources used for this study, discuss preliminary analysis conducted, detailed review of the results and a brief discussion of potential outcomes from this work. \n"
