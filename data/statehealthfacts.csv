"Unemployment Insurance (UI) provides unemployment benefits, usually in the form of weekly payments, to eligible workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own, and meet certain other eligibility requirements. UI is administered jointly by the U.S. Department of Labor and individual states. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, new federal law expands eligiblity for UI and provides additional temporary benefits. The weekly UI data reported here are not seasonally adjusted."

"*Initial Unemployment Claims* measures the number of people filing unemployment insurance claims during the past week and reflects emerging unemployment.. *Continued Unemployment Claims* measures the number of people receiving unemployment insurance benefits during a given week. *Insured Unemployment Rate* is the number of people receiving unemployment insurance as a percentage of the labor force. This measure should not be confused with the national unemployment rate, which measures the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labor force and includes those who are not receiving unemployment benefits. *N/A*: Data not available. Data on continued unemployment claims and insured unemployment rate are only available through 10/23/2021."

"The unemployment rate measures unemployment within the civilian non-institutional population aged 16 years and older. Data refer to place of residence. Data for Puerto Rico are derived from a monthly household survey similar to the Current Population Survey. Area definitions are based on Office of Management and Budget Bulletin No. 15-01, dated July 15, 2015, and are available on the BLS website at [http://www.bls.gov/lau/lausmsa.htm](http://www.bls.gov/lau/lausmsa.htm). Numerical data are rounded to the nearest thousand. State numerical data may not sum to the national total due to rounding.

"For more current data using the Current Population Survey, see [Poverty Rate by Age (CPS)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-age-cps/).

This is the official measurement of poverty used by the Federal Government, and the measure used for most poverty-based data presented on State Health Facts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces simplified - but very similar - versions of these poverty thresholds called ""poverty guidelines"" that are used to assess eligibility for income-based programs such as Medicaid.

"Definitions"
"*General Fund*: Predominant fund for financing a state’s operations. Revenues are received from broad-based state taxes. There are differences in how specific functions are financed from state to state, however. *Federal Funds*: Funds received directly from the federal government.  *Other State Funds*: Expenditures from revenue sources, which are restricted by law for particular governmental functions or activities. For example, a gasoline tax dedicated to a highway trust fund would appear in the ""Other State Funds"" column.  *Bonds*: Expenditures from the sale of bonds, generally for capital projects. *State Funds*: General fund plus other state fund spending, excluding state spending from bonds. *State Fiscal Year*: In 46 states the state fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. The exceptions are as follows: in New York, the fiscal year begins on April 1; in Texas, the fiscal year begins on September 1; and in Alabama and Michigan the fiscal year begins on October 1. *N/A*: Data not available."
